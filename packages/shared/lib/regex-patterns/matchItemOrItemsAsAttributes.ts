 transformed to \b\w*data-testid\w*\b=["-'][^"]*["-']
// v1 String.raw`\b\w*${regexp}\w*\b="(.*?)"`, 3 sep just "

// v2 \b\w*data-testid\w*\b=["'{][^"'{}]*["'}]

// v3 \b\w*data-testid\w*\b=["'{]*[\S]*['}"]
    - * is repeating previous match till next group
    - [] is a set to match 1 character (can be repeated with *)
    - \S is any non space character

// v4 \b\w*(?:\bdata\-testid\b|\bplaceholder\b)\w*\b=["'{]*[\S]*['}"]
   - support for matching everything enclosed for multiple words
   - split into \b \b padded words so that it matches the full words
   - escaped -'s in word match so that it doesn't treat it as a range
   - conditionally set pattern.
 action: test these regexes seperately against lots of possible variants.

// V5 (Post test) - spaced attributes {'a b'} 'a b c'

v5 \b\w*(?:\bdata\-testid\b|\bplaceholder\b)\w*\b=["'{]*.*?['}"]
 - .*? https://stackoverflow.com/a/36519867 to capture every character
 next problem is that it doesn't capture a final } as it isn't repeating characters up to final
 solution
V5 Final \b\w*(?:\bdata\-testid\b|\bplaceholder\b)\w*\b=["'{`]*.*?(?:'}|"}|`}|`|'|")
 changed beyond =
 - (?: capture all
 - that is ', ", '}, "}), `, `} as the boundary [note back ticks are added here too for variable attrs]
